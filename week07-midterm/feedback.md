Score: 50/50

1 - Nice work including tests to make sure that the parameters matched the data type and domain you needed.  Good, defensive programming.

One note on that, however, is that it won't always work with numbers the way you hope/want.  For example, testing the troponin score in Part 2.  If the troponin varilable was a string instead of a float, your code would just simply fail rather than raising the exception you're trying to raise.

Great work throughout!
