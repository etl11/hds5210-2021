Congratulations on completing your Python final project.  I hope that you got some valuable experience and knowledge from our work together this semester.  Please feel free to reach out to me any time in the future.  You can connect with me on LinkedIn and message me there any time.  I look forward to seeing what the future has in store for you.

Here's feedback on your final project, but if you'd like more detail, please reach out to me.

Nice work modularizing your code.  That's going to make it much easier to understand what you're doing step by step.

The plots you did were succint and clear.  I could have used some more explanation of the applicability of what you were doing, though.  What conclusions can we reach based on comparing the trend in population growth with the trends in these other metrics?  I think plotting their correlation might have been insightful: population on x-axis and the other metrics on the y-axis.
